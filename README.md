qstat-use-by-users
==================

We were curious to see who was running jobs on our grid and how many jobs were running per user. I figured this would be a quick one or two liner and it really isn't much longer. You can feed this to a text file to parse on a dash or just run it for no better reason than curiosity. I'll work on sorting by #jobs next.
